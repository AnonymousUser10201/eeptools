\alias{leading_zero}
\title{Function to add leading zeroes to maintain fixed width.}
\usage{
leading_zero(x, digits = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of numeric data that should be fixed width but is
missing leading zeroes.}

\item{digits}{an integer representing the desired width of \code{x}}
}
\value{
A character vector of length \code{digits}
}
\description{
This function ensures that fixed width data is the right
length by padding zeroes to the front of values. This is a common problem
with fixed width data after importing into R as non-character type.
}
\examples{
a <- seq(1,10)
a <- leading_zero(a, digits = 3)
a
