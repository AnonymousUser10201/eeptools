# Introduction

eeptools is a project for R that seeks to make it easier for administrators at 
state and local education agencies to analyze and visualize their data on student, 
school, and district performance. By putting simple wrappers around a number of 
R functions to make many common tasks simpler and lower the barrier to entry to 
statistical analysis.

The goal is not to invent new functionality for R, but instead to lower the 
barrier of entry to doing common and routine data manipulation, visualization, 
and analysis tasks with education data. By collaborating with other users of 
education data we can build transparent, efficient, reproducible, and easy to use 
functions for analysts.

# Datasets

`eeptools` provides three new datasets of interest to education researchers. 

```{r}
library(eeptools)
data("stuatt")
head(stuatt)
```

The `stuatt`, student attributes, dataset is provided from the [Strategic Data 
Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](http://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use). 
This dataset is useful for learning how to clean data in R and how to aggregate 
and summarize individual unit-record data into group-level data. 

```{r}
data(stulevel)
head(stulevel)

```

The `stulevel` dataset is a simulated student-level longitudinal record. 

```{r}
data("midsch")
head(midsch)

```

The `midsch` dataset contains an analysis on abnormality in school average 
assessment scores. 

# Administrative Data Functions

For analysts using unit-record data of some type, there are several `calc` functions 
which automate common tasks including calculating ages (`age_calc`), 
grade retention (`retained_calc`), and student mobility (`moves_calc`).


```{r}
age_calc(dob = as.Date('1995-01-15'), enddate = as.Date('2003-02-16'))

```

```{r}

x <- data.frame(sid = c(101, 101, 102, 103, 103, 103, 104, 105, 105, 106, 106),
                 grade = c(9, 10, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 8, 9, 7, 7))
  retained_calc(x)
```



```{r}

df <- data.frame(sid = c(rep(1,3), rep(2,4), 3, rep(4,2)),
                   schid = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1),
                   enroll_date = as.Date(c('2004-08-26',
                                           '2004-10-01',
                                           '2005-05-01',

                   exit_date = as.Date(c('2004-08-26',
                                         '2005-04-10',
